// states are used to handling events , checking the current state of the attribute
// can be used to make new buttons so that we can make it more functionalities after 
// clicking it 
// for example - if we make a counter from 1 to 100 

// to handle the states we have to make a event listeneres which will
// handle the states of the target

// things to add more in the project
